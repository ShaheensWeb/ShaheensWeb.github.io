# ShaheensWeb.github.io
Personal blog created for the purpose of blogging, redirecting internship traffic, and overall design practice. <br />

The blog is hosted via github pages (hence the repo name being Username.github.io) and is currently being redirected <br />
via CNAME and proper DNS setup for re-routing to shaheensweb.me, a purchased domain from Namecheap.com for roughly 8-10$ <br />

In terms of design this web domain uses aspects of: <br />
&nbsp;-> HTML5<br />
&nbsp;-> CSS<br />
&nbsp;-> jQuery <br />
&nbsp;-> JS <br />
  
This website contains: <br />
&nbsp;-> Resume <br />
&nbsp;-> Work Experience <br />
&nbsp;-> Online Web Presence <br />
