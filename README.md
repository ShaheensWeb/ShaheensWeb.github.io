# ShaheensWeb.github.io
Personal blog created for the purpose of blogging, redirecting internship traffic, and overall design practice. <br\>

The blog is hosted via github pages (hence the repo name being Username.github.io) and is currently being redirected <br\>
via CNAME and proper DNS setup for re-routing to shaheensweb.me, a purchased domain from Namecheap.com for roughly 8-10$ <br\>

In terms of design this web domain uses aspects of: <br\>
  -> HTML5<br\>
  -> CSS<br\>
  -> jQuery <br\>
  -> JS <br\>
